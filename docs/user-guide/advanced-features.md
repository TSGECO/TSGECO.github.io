# Advanced Features

This guide covers more sophisticated features and capabilities of the TSG Ecosystem.

## Advanced Graph Operations

### Custom Properties and Annotations

You can attach custom properties to both segments and connections:

```python
# Add custom properties to a segment
graph.add_segment_properties("seg_001", {
    "confidence_score": 0.98,
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "keywords": ["introduction", "welcome", "interview"]
})

# Update properties on a connection
graph.update_connection_properties("seg_001", "seg_002", {
    "transition_quality": "smooth",
    "topic_continuity": 0.75
})
```

### Graph Filtering and Views

Create filtered views of your graph for specific analyses:

```python
from tsgeco import TSGFilter

# Create a filter for high-confidence segments from a specific speaker
filter = TSGFilter()
filter.add_property_condition("speaker", "Dr. Smith")
filter.add_property_condition("confidence_score", 0.9, operator=">")

# Apply the filter to get a new graph with only the matching segments
filtered_graph = filter.apply(graph)

# You can also create time-slice views
time_slice = graph.create_time_slice(start_time=120.0, end_time=180.0)
```

## Advanced Analytics

### Semantic Analysis

Extract meaning and relationships from your transcript content:

```python
from tsgeco.analytics import semantic_analysis, topic_modeling

# Perform semantic analysis on the transcript
semantic_results = semantic_analysis(graph)

# Extract key topics from the conversation
topics = topic_modeling(graph, num_topics=5)
for topic_id, topic_data in topics.items():
    print(f"Topic {topic_id}: {', '.join(topic_data['keywords'])}")
    print(f"Segments: {', '.join(topic_data['top_segments'])}")
```

### Speaker Interaction Analysis

Analyze patterns of interaction between speakers:

```python
from tsgeco.analytics import interaction_analysis

# Analyze back-and-forth between speakers
interaction_data = interaction_analysis(graph)

# Get turn-taking statistics
print(f"Average turn length: {interaction_data['avg_turn_length']}s")
print(f"Speaker overlap instances: {interaction_data['overlap_count']}")

# Get speaker interaction graph
interaction_graph = interaction_data['speaker_graph']
```

## Advanced Visualization

### Customizing Visualizations

```python
from tsgeco.visualizer import TSGVisualizer

viz = TSGVisualizer(graph)

# Customize the appearance
viz.set_theme("dark")
viz.set_color_scheme({
    "Interviewer": "#1f77b4",
    "Dr. Smith": "#ff7f0e"
})

# Highlight specific segments
viz.highlight_segments(["seg_001", "seg_005", "seg_023"], color="#d62728")

# Add annotations
viz.add_annotation("seg_001", "Opening question")
viz.add_annotation("seg_005", "Key research finding")

# Generate the visualization
viz.to_html("custom_visualization.html")
```

### Interactive Dashboards

Create interactive dashboards for exploring your transcript data:

```python
from tsgeco.visualizer import TSGDashboard

# Create a dashboard with multiple visualization components
dashboard = TSGDashboard(graph)

# Add visualization components
dashboard.add_timeline()
dashboard.add_speaker_breakdown()
dashboard.add_topic_network()
dashboard.add_sentiment_analysis()

# Generate an interactive dashboard
dashboard.to_html("transcript_dashboard.html")
```

## Batch Processing

Process multiple transcripts efficiently:

```python
from tsgeco.batch import BatchProcessor

# Create a batch processor
processor = BatchProcessor()

# Add processing tasks
processor.add_task("import", source_format="srt", folder="./transcripts/")
processor.add_task("analyze", analyses=["basic_stats", "speaker_analysis"])
processor.add_task("export", target_format="tsg", output_folder="./processed/")

# Run the batch processing
results = processor.run()
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### Audio Processing Integration

Link TSG data with audio processing tools:

```python
from tsgeco.integrations import audio

# Align TSG with audio file
aligned_graph = audio.align_with_audio(graph, "interview.wav")

# Extract audio features
audio_features = audio.extract_features("interview.wav",
                                      features=["pitch", "volume"])

# Annotate TSG with audio features
graph = audio.annotate_with_features(graph, audio_features)
```

### Machine Learning Integration

Use pre-trained models or train custom models on your TSG data:

```python
from tsgeco.ml import sentiment_analyzer, entity_recognizer

# Apply sentiment analysis to segments
sentiment_results = sentiment_analyzer.analyze(graph)

# Extract named entities from transcript
entities = entity_recognizer.extract(graph)
```

## Performance Optimization

For large transcripts and datasets:

```python
from tsgeco import TSGConfig

# Configure performance settings
TSGConfig.set("use_parallel_processing", True)
TSGConfig.set("cache_results", True)
TSGConfig.set("cache_directory", "./tsgeco_cache/")

# For GPU acceleration
TSGConfig.set("use_gpu", True)
```
